# POC 4
## Generating an angular application in several steps
In this poc, we start from a blank angular application archetype.
We ask the AI to generate component by component from the screenshots, and we integrate them into our code one by one.
## Prompt used
Here is the prompt that was used : [Prompt 4](https://github.com/jpdacunha/fa-ia-poc/blob/main/prompts/Prompt-poc-4.txt)
## Generated Application
After executing the prompt step by step, the AI generated the components that we integrated one by one into the initial archetype, and we ended up asking it to generate the routing between the pages.

## Result
We started from a blank archetype, and included the components generated by the AI from the screenshots we provided one by one, then we integrated the routing part, and in the end we obtained an application that works well.
