## Introduction
The goal of this POC is to use AI to generate an Angular application from screenshots.

## How was the application generated ?
For each poc, an application is generated from a [prompt](https://github.com/jpdacunha/fa-ia-poc/tree/main/prompts) provided to an AI ([Bolt](https://bolt.new)) .
